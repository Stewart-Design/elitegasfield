## On Site

We have implemented a stringent Safety and Training program that consists of:

  - Specific OSHA requirements relating to the Oil and Gas Industry

## On the Road

Driving performance is as critical to our company’s success as any other aspect of our operation. To continually monitor and improve driving performance, we have implemented:

  - Speed Gauge – Tracks driver habits and sends emails instantaneously if a driver exceeds the
  - threshold set by the safety team. All drivers are scored on speeding and awarded for safe driving habits.
  - Lytx Dash Cams – 3rd party company that captures at-risk driving habits and sends the video to the Elite safety team for the purpose of coaching and mentoring our drivers. This tool has changed the dynamics of our company.

## Safety Stats:

  - 5 million miles without a major accident and counting
  - IS NET World / Avetta 3rd party auditing services required by some of our operators

  - 59% reduction in speed since 2015 (tracked by Speed Gauge)

We believe that by working together and making safety a critical part of our day-to-day operations, we can achieve our primary goals – zero harm to every individual and zero environmental impact.
